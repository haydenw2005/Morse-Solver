# Morse-Solver
A program that calculates and sorts all possible permutations of Morse code with unspecified character breaks.

# Background
After graduating, I received as a gift a bracelet from my grandmother that contained a message hidden in Morse code. However, there were no breaks between words or characters, making it impossible to decipher by hand. To tackle the problem, I created a program that recursively iterates through every possible combination of characters and then sorts them into possible phrases. While incredibly slow and burdensome, the brute force approach was fascinating and forced me to think critically about the nature of Morse code. Who knew that such short phrases could amount to many millions of permutations? After finishing the program, the code was revealed to be "Never Give Up."
